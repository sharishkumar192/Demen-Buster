# Demen-Buster

The main objective of our Android app is to help people to check if they have Alzheimerâ€™s by playing some games and answering some quizzes. Users can choose to either play the games individually or, take the full test whichcomprises all the games one after another and gives you some final scores based on your results. If the scoreis below 13, then the user might have to consult a neurologist and our app suggests top neurologists, the top20 hospitals and care centers along with other details such as description, contact number, and location.
